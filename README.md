# TBA: Electronic Structure Calculations via TBA
For many materials, the electronic structure near Ferimi energy can be obtained by means of tight-binding approximations. Unlike DFT, which deals with the full electronic structure density, TBA considers the electronic wavefunctions as localized atomic-like orbitals. Tight-binding models not only have the ability to achieve high accuracy like DFT but also have lower computational cost. Here, I show some basic examples that I encountered during my study on TBA.
